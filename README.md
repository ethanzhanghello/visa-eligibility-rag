## üéØ Overview
Green Card RAG Helper is an intelligent assistant designed to provide accurate, context-aware responses to immigration-related questions in both English and Chinese. Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it combines the power of vector search with language models to deliver precise, factual answers based on reliable immigration information.

**Key Features:**
- **Bilingual Support**: English and Chinese question handling
- **Confidence Scoring**: Automatic detection of low-confidence responses
- **Expert Review System**: Professional validation of uncertain answers
- **Anti-Bias Protection**: Source tracking and validation pipeline
- **Continuous Learning**: Integration of expert-reviewed content into FAQ database

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Language Model**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
- **Embeddings**: Multilingual E5 Base Model
- **API**: FastAPI
- **Backend**: Python 3.9+
- **Caching**: Redis (with in-memory fallback)
- **Testing**: pytest
- **Dependencies Management**: pip

## üìã Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- 2GB+ free disk space for vector database
- RAM: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- Internet connection for API calls
- FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Redis (optional, falls back to in-memory cache)

## üíª Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/green-card-rag-helper.git
cd green-card-rag-helper
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

4. (Optional) Install and start Redis for persistent caching:
```bash
# macOS
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis
```

## üöÄ Usage
1. Populate the vector database:
```bash
python populate_db.py
```

2. Run the API server:
```bash
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```

3. API Endpoints:
- `POST /query` - Submit immigration questions
- `GET /health` - Check API health
- `POST /cache/clear` - Clear all cached responses
- `GET /cache/stats` - View cache statistics

4. Example queries:
```python
from src.retrieval.retrieval_manager import RetrievalManager
from src.llm.llm_manager import LLMManager

retrieval_manager = RetrievalManager()
llm_manager = LLMManager()

# English query
results = retrieval_manager.process_query("What documents do I need for EB-2?")
response = llm_manager.generate_response(context, query)

# Chinese query
results = retrieval_manager.process_query("ÊàëÈúÄË¶ÅÂì™‰∫õÊñá‰ª∂Êù•Áî≥ËØ∑ EB-2Ôºü")
response = llm_manager.generate_response(context, query)
```

## üîç Low-Confidence Question Detection

The system automatically detects when it's not confident in its responses and flags them for expert review.

### How It Works:
1. **Confidence Scoring**: Each response is evaluated based on:
   - Context relevance to the question
   - Source quality and official documentation
   - Response length and completeness
   - Presence of immigration-specific terminology

2. **Automatic Flagging**: Questions with confidence scores below 0.7 are automatically flagged for expert review

3. **Frequency Tracking**: Repeated low-confidence questions are prioritized for review

### Confidence Factors:
- **Context Relevance**: How well the retrieved context matches the question
- **Source Quality**: Presence of official government sources
- **Response Completeness**: Length and structure of the answer
- **Immigration Terms**: Proper use of immigration-specific vocabulary

## üë®‚Äçüíº Expert Review Workflow

### For Users:
1. **Ask Questions**: Submit immigration questions normally
2. **Get Responses**: Receive immediate answers with confidence scores
3. **Transparency**: See if your question was flagged for expert review

### For Experts:
1. **Review Dashboard**: Access pending questions via `/expert/pending-questions`
2. **Submit Reviews**: Provide professional answers with sources via `/expert/review`
3. **Validation**: System validates reviews for bias and quality
4. **Integration**: Approved answers are added to the FAQ database

### Anti-Bias Features:
- **Source Validation**: Requires official government sources
- **Expert Credentials**: Tracks reviewer qualifications
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all changes
- **Quality Checks**: Validates answer length, relevance, and completeness

## üîå API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints
- `POST /query` - Submit questions and get responses with confidence scores
- `GET /health` - Check system health
- `GET /cache/stats` - View caching statistics
